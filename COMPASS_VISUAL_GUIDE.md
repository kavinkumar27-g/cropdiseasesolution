## 🔍 **Schema Analysis in Compass**

### **Field Types You'll See:**
```
📊 Schema Analysis (diseases collection)
├── _id: ObjectId (100% - Primary Key)
├── name: String (100% - Disease names)
├── description: String (100% - Disease descriptions)  
└── solutions: Array (100% - Treatment solutions)
    ├── type: String (organic/inorganic)
    ├── solution: String (treatment description)
    ├── effectiveness: String (High/Medium/Low/Very High)
    └── application: String (application instructions)
```

### **Data Distribution:**
```
📈 Document Statistics:
• Total Documents: 18 diseases
• Average Solutions per Disease: 3-4 treatments
• Organic Solutions: ~36 treatments
• Chemical Solutions: ~30 treatments
• Effectiveness Levels: High, Very High, Medium
```

## 🔎 **Useful Queries for Compass**

### **Basic Queries:**

**1. Find All Diseases:**
```javascript
{}
```

**2. Find Organic Solutions Only:**
```javascript
{"solutions.type": "organic"}
```

**3. Find High Effectiveness Treatments:**
```javascript
{"solutions.effectiveness": "High"}
```

**4. Search for Mildew Diseases:**
```javascript
{"name": {"$regex": "mildew", "$options": "i"}}
```

**5. Find Diseases with 4+ Solutions:**
```javascript
{"solutions.3": {"$exists": true}}
```

### **Advanced Queries:**

**6. Count Organic vs Chemical Solutions:**
```javascript
[
  {"$unwind": "$solutions"},
  {"$group": {
    "_id": "$solutions.type",
    "count": {"$sum": 1}
  }}
]
```

**7. Find Most Effective Treatments:**
```javascript
{"solutions.effectiveness": "Very High"}
```
